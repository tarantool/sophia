Monitoring
----------

Database monitoring is possible by [getting](../tutorial/configuration.md) current dynamic statistics and configuration via
[sp_env()](../api/sp_env.md) object.

Performance metrics are described in the [Performance](../conf/performance.md)
configuration section.

To get current memory usage or trace every worker thread see [Memory](../conf/memory.md),
[Performance](../conf/performance.md) and [Scheduler](../conf/scheduler.md) sections.

To get per-database metrics see [Database](../conf/database.md) sections.
